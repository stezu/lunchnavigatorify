lunchnavigatorify
=================

When you can't decide on lunch, this will make it worse.


TODO
========
- ability to add an org
- ability to define/change an org's zip
- user accounts (passport perhaps?)
- clean up search box/results styles
- make it look a little nicer
  - a cool font would be neat
  - get that default favicon out of there, thats rookie shit
- a 'totally random' (name pending) feature would be cool that just returns a random restaurant from a zip code
